# GraysQL #

GraysQL is a manager and loader for [GraphQL](http://graphql.org). It provides
a uniform way of organize your GraphQL schema. GraphQL tries to create an easy
to read codebase. It features a plugins API to allow the extension of the core
functionalities.

It's directly compatible with the [GraphQL](http://github.com/graphql/graphql-js)
reference implementation.
